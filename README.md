# Clustering - Advanced Concepts
Genie method and DBSCAN method

Considering worms_2 data sets (data are available at https://github.com/gagolews/clustering-data-v1/tree/master/sipu).

In the project using Genie method and DBSCAN method, determining the data partition. Using cluster validity measures in order to determine appropriate values of method parameters, if needed.

- Comparing your solution to the one that is given (we will consider this reference solution).
- Visualising the results obtained using selected data visualisation techniques.
- Evaluating the quality of your solution.

The results are descripted in **Data_Clustering_report_Krzysztof_Wolny** file.
